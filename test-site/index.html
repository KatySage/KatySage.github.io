 <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>After working in the veterinary industry for several years, I have decided that it's time for a career change. I am an aspiring full stack developer, with a special interest in databases. I enjoy hiking, crossword puzzles, hanging out with my dog, and playing World of Warcraft.</p>
    <p>I am excited to learn more alongside others in the DigitalCrafts course!</p>
